    <h2 id ="header1" style="text-align:center;">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Nathaniel Ngo. I am a CIS major and currently 
        in my senior year of college at Bradley University. I plan to graduate in Fall 2022.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2 id ="header2" style="text-align:center;">About me</h2>
    <p>
        I was born in Peoria, Illinois and have lived here my whole life. My interests include video games, film/TV, and music.
         When it comes to video games I usually like to play games in the FPS or RPG genres. With film/TV I basically watch whatever is interesting
          to me, and for music I primarily like hip-hop/rap, pop, and electronic.
    </p>
    <p>
        As for favorites in each of my interests, my favorite TV show is HBO's "The Wire". It is a show set in Baltimore, Maryland about both the police force
          and the criminals that they pursue. Two of my favorite movies are Blade Runner 2049 and Thoroughbreds.
           Some of my favorite video games are:
           <ul>
               <li>Monster Hunter: World</li>
               <li>The Yakuza series</li>
               <li>Apex Legends</li>
               <li>Cyberpunk 2077</li>
           </ul>
            Lastly as far as music is concerned, some of my favorite music artists are:
            <ul>
                <li>Bladee</li>
                <li>Grimes</li>
                <li>Charli XCX</li>
                <li>CHVRCHES</li>
                <li>$uicideboy$</li>
                <li>Travis Scott</li>
            </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        As a fun fact, if I did not choose CIS as my major, I would probably major in something film related
         instead.
    </p>
    <h2 id ="header3" style="text-align:center;">Achievements</h2>
    <p>
        I have a decent amount of experience with:
        <ul>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>C++</li>
            <li>Discrete Math</li>
            <li>Data Structures in C++</li>
            <li>Computer Architecture</li>
            <li>Cybersecurity</li>
        </ul>
         and I am learning Javascript, HTML, and CSS this semester. I have my Associate's degree in LAS from Illinois Central College and plan on obtaining
          a Bachelor's in my major (CIS).
    </p>
    <p>
        Alongside my experiences with IT-focused areas, I also have taken classes on:
        <ul>
            <li>Management Results in Organizations</li>
            <li>Human Factors Psychology</li>
            <li>Organizational Communication</li>
        </ul>
        These skills are also important
          to a CIS major.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2016 I worked as a student intern at Caterpillar in their IT area. I do not have
         any job experience other than that, but plan to change that once I graduate.
          I would like to work in the data analyzing field because it sounds like something
           I would enjoy, but otherwise I do not really have a preference as long as I am comfortable
            in my job and make enough money to live modestly.
